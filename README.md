# TauLeapingCode

Tau leaping simulations of Glycine moleuces on Cu110


Use the Makefile to compile with gfotran.

The input parameters are specified in system.in.

ntriangle n       - n number of triangles representing each a Glycine molecule.
posNxy n1 n2      - number of copper atoms in x (n1) an y (n2) direction
temp t            - t the temperature for the rate calulations from DFT energy barriers  
hbondstr hbs      - strength of H-bond between neighboring O and N atoms in Gly
nkmcsteps n       - n number of tauleaping steps/ moves of a single triangle until algorithm stops
printlevel n      - n number of steps after which a full print out to files should be written

If isl-type1 and isl-type2 are set to 0 and their size is 0 the Gly molecules 
will be randomly distributed over the copper surface.

The triangles have a certain arrangement in the paper. If
type=1 heterochiral clusters will be arranged color 12 34, 
type=2 homochiral clussters are possible color 1 2 3 4 
colors denote: 1 green, 2 red, 3 yellow, 4 blue.
The colours are chosen with color-isl1 and color-isl2 according to the type. 
The implementation allows to have 1 or 2 islands on the surface.

isl1-size-xy and isl2-size-xy specify the size of the clusters in x y directions in terms of number of molecules.
isl1-pos-xy and isl2-pos-xy determine the left lower corner of the Gly clusters on the xy-plane of copper atoms.
isl1-defect-type and isl2-defect-type allow to take out 1 or 2 Gly molecules from the clusters at position
isl1-defects-xy x1 y1 x2 y2 and 
isl2-defects-xy x1 y1 x2 y2,
x1 y1 x2 y2 being the respective coordinates.


Additionally, there can be one or two 'defective' areas on the metal surface, 
where the Gly molecules are not allowed to move to.
mdefect1-type and mdefect2-type turn it with 1 on and with 0 off.
mdefect1-size-xy and mdefect2-size-xy x1 y1 give the number of atoms in x1 and y1 direction which cannot react.
mdefect1-pos-xy and mdefect2-pos-xy determine the left lower corner of the defective areas on the xy-plane of copper atoms.

All results are written to vtk files which can than visualised in PARAVIEW from http://www.paraview.org/.
The final important feature is the possibility to restart from an input vtk file. With
restartTrue restart.vtk
The file restart.vtk copied from a triangle000*.vtk allows to restart from an intermediate output file.
Make sure the system.in is not changed apart from the restartTrue line being added.
